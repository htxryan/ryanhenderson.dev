name: Build Great Things
description: Comprehensive playbook for building world-class websites, landing pages, web applications, and dashboards. Covers the full build sequence from brand identity and information architecture through layout, typography, color, scroll animations, micro-interactions, hover effects, loading states, empty states, error handling, accessibility, SEO, and conversion optimization. Use this skill whenever building a new website or web app from scratch, redesigning pages (pricing, landing, portfolio), adding polish or animations, fixing generic-looking UI, improving visual hierarchy, or when the user says anything looks "janky", "generic", "amateur", or "needs more polish". Also use when adding hover states, scroll effects, page transitions, or doing a design review pass.

# How to Build Great Things

You are building something that will be seen, used, and judged by real humans. Your default instinct is to get it working and move on. That instinct produces mediocre output. This skill exists to override that instinct.

**The north star is taste and judgment.** World-class products are not just functional — they are intentional in every detail: typography that reads beautifully, spacing that breathes, motion that guides, states that never surprise. The difference between "works" and "exceptional" is not talent — it is the discipline to never skip the steps that feel optional but aren't.

**You have unlimited time.** You are a long-running agent. There is no deadline pressure. There is no excuse for cutting corners. Every phase below exists because skipping it produces output that a discerning human will immediately recognize as AI-generated slop.

## Design Philosophy

Three intellectual foundations underpin this skill — one for code architecture, one for visual design, and one for structural connectivity. Together they provide the *why* behind every principle in the phases that follow.

### Complexity is the root cause (Ousterhout)

John Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design* identifies a single organizing insight: **complexity is the root cause of nearly all difficulty in software**. It manifests as three symptoms — change amplification (one conceptual change requires edits in many places), cognitive load (the reader must hold too much context to understand the code), and unknown unknowns (it is not obvious what needs to change). Every architectural decision you make either contains complexity or leaks it.

The principles that follow from this:

- **Deep modules, not shallow ones.** A component should have a simple interface that hides substantial internal complexity — the same philosophy as headless primitives (Radix, React Aria). A `<DatePicker>` with 30 props is a shallow module; one with 3 props that internally handles timezone, locale, and parsing is deep. *Measure interface cost against hidden complexity.*
- **Pull complexity downward.** When complexity must exist, push it into the implementation rather than exporting it through configuration props, environment variables, or required setup steps. It is more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation.
- **Different layer, different abstraction.** Each layer should add genuine conceptual value. A pass-through component that merely forwards props to a child is the UI equivalent of a pass-through method — it adds indirection without adding abstraction. Token layers (primitive → semantic → component) should each represent a distinct level of design decision.
- **Define errors out of existence.** Instead of handling every possible validation error, design flows and APIs so entire categories of errors cannot occur — autofill defaults, constrained input types, smart type coercion. The best error message is one that never needs to appear.
- **Strategic, not tactical.** A tactical programmer (or a tactical AI) gets things working and moves on. A strategic one invests 10-20% additional effort in good structure, knowing it compounds. This skill exists to make you strategic.
- **Design it twice.** Before committing to a component API, state architecture, or page layout, sketch two meaningfully different approaches and compare their trade-offs. The first design that comes to mind is rarely the best.

*Full survey: `docs/compound/research/development/software-design/philosophy-of-software-design.md`*

### Constraint-based design (Wathan & Schoger)

Refactoring UI's core insight is that **visual design becomes programmable when reduced to constrained decision spaces**. Instead of choosing from infinite possibilities for spacing, type size, color, and shadow, you define a finite scale and pick only from that scale. This is especially powerful for an AI agent — constrained decision spaces produce more consistent output than open-ended aesthetic judgment.

The perceptual science behind the constraints:

- **Weber-Fechner law** justifies geometric (multiplicative) spacing scales. Equal arithmetic increments (4px, 8px, 12px, 16px) do not produce perceptually equal steps — the jump from 8→12 is far more visible than 48→52. A geometric scale (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64) produces perceptually uniform increments because perceived intensity scales logarithmically with physical magnitude.
- **Preattentive processing** (Treisman) explains visual hierarchy. The human visual system processes color, size, and weight in parallel in under 200ms — before conscious attention engages. Hierarchy works through three channels (size, weight, color), and **de-emphasis is as important as emphasis**: reducing the salience of secondary elements increases the relative salience of the primary element without adding visual noise.
- **Gestalt proximity** is the most powerful grouping principle — it overrides color and shape similarity. Maintain more space *between* groups than *within* groups, and the structure communicates itself without borders or dividers.
- **Border alternatives.** Borders are a crutch. Spacing, background color differences, and shadows separate content more elegantly and with less visual clutter. Reach for a border only after trying these three alternatives.

*Full survey: `docs/compound/research/design/web-apps/refactoring-ui-design-principles.md`*

### System coherence is craft (Surface Alignment)

The first two foundations address code architecture and visual design. This third addresses the connective tissue between layers. A great product is not just well-structured and beautiful — it is *connected*. Every layer talks to every other layer through verified channels, not assumed ones.

The core failure mode of AI-assisted development is **disconnected layers**: a frontend that renders beautifully but calls an API endpoint that doesn't exist, an API that accepts requests but never persists to the database, a migration that runs but doesn't match the ORM models, generated types that were committed once and never updated. Each layer passes its own tests in isolation, but the system as a whole doesn't work.

The antidote is **surface alignment** — the discipline of verifying that derived artifacts match their source of truth, that layers enforce directional dependencies, and that integration tests hit real infrastructure instead of mocks. This is not separate from craft — it *is* craft. A building with beautiful interiors but no plumbing is not a well-designed building. A web application with polished UI but disconnected persistence is not a well-built product.

The principles:

- **Single source of truth, derived everything else.** Database models generate migrations. API schemas generate client types. The source changes; the artifacts are regenerated and committed. CI fails if they drift. This is the regenerate-and-diff pattern — the most reliable way to prevent layer divergence.
- **Test through the real stack.** Integration tests that substitute SQLite for PostgreSQL, or mock the HTTP layer, provide false confidence. The semantic differences between databases are exactly where production bugs hide. Use Testcontainers, transaction rollback, or template databases — not mocks.
- **Enforce layer isolation mechanically.** Import rules (`import-linter`, `dependency-cruiser`, `arch-go`, ArchUnit) catch structural violations at CI time. Without them, domain logic gradually accumulates framework imports, and the architecture diagram becomes fiction.
- **Every route is either public or protected.** Dynamic route scanning tests discover all endpoints and verify that non-public ones require authentication. Without this, new unprotected routes slip through silently.

## Mandatory Quality Checklist

**Run this before declaring ANY build complete.** Every unchecked item is a sign of lazy craft.

### States
- [ ] Every page has a loading state (skeleton, shimmer, or spinner — never a blank screen)
- [ ] Every data-dependent view has an empty state with illustration, copy, and CTA
- [ ] Error states exist for all failure modes (network, auth, validation, 404, 500)
- [ ] Offline/degraded states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Partial data states render correctly (not just full-data and empty)

### Interaction
- [ ] Every interactive element has distinct hover, active, focus, and disabled states
- [ ] Focus styles are visible and keyboard-navigable (not just browser defaults)
- [ ] Buttons have press feedback (scale, color shift, or both)
- [ ] Form inputs have clear validation feedback (inline, not just on submit)
- [ ] Page transitions are not hard cuts (fade, slide, or morph)

### Visual Craft
- [ ] Typography uses at least 3 levels of visual hierarchy (not just font size — weight and color too)
- [ ] De-emphasis used for secondary content (muted color, lighter weight, smaller size) — not just emphasis for primary content
- [ ] Spacing uses a geometric scale (4/8/16/24/32/48/64 — not arbitrary values)
- [ ] No borders used purely for separation where spacing, background color, or shadow would suffice
- [ ] Shadows follow a consistent elevation scale (not arbitrary box-shadow values)

- [ ] Icons are consistent in style, weight, and size

### Responsiveness
- [ ] Mobile is a first-class experience, not a shrunken desktop
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44x44px on mobile
- [ ] Typography is fluid (clamp-based, not fixed breakpoints only)
- [ ] No horizontal scroll on any viewport

### Performance
- [ ] Core Web Vitals pass (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1)

## Common AI Laziness Patterns

Ousterhout calls the programmer who optimizes for speed-of-shipping over structure a "tactical tornado" — someone who gets things working fast but leaves a wake of complexity for every future change. These are the specific ways you will default to tactical tornado behavior if you don't actively resist:

1. **Tactical component design**: Shallow components with sprawling prop interfaces that leak implementation complexity upward. *Instead*: Design deep components — simple interfaces hiding substantial internal complexity. Pull complexity downward.

2. **Generic UI**: Using default Tailwind colors, Inter font, standard component library look. *Instead*: Every project deserves a curated palette, specific typeface pairing, and deliberate whitespace system built from constrained scales.

3. **Skipping the polish phase**: Getting features working and declaring done. *Instead*: Phase 04 (Motion) and Phase 05 (Polish) are not optional. They are where "works" becomes "exceptional."

4. **First-design-only**: Implementing the first approach that comes to mind without considering alternatives. *Instead*: Design it twice. Sketch two meaningfully different approaches for any non-trivial component, layout, or state architecture before committing.

5. **Ignoring visual hierarchy**: Content is present but layout, spacing, and typography don't guide the eye. *Instead*: Use all three hierarchy channels (size, weight, color). De-emphasize secondary elements rather than over-emphasizing primary ones.

6. **Missing edge states**: Only building the happy path. *Instead*: Empty, loading, error, partial, and offline states are not edge cases — they are the states users encounter most. Define errors out of existence where possible; design graceful recovery where not.

7. **Flat interactions**: No hover effects, no transitions, no feedback. *Instead*: Every click, hover, and scroll should feel responsive. Silence from the UI feels broken.

8. **Cookie-cutter layouts**: Every section looks like every other section. *Instead*: Visual rhythm requires variation — alternate section structures, vary content density, use negative space as a design element.

9. **Borders everywhere**: Reaching for `border-b` to separate every section and list item. *Instead*: Try spacing, background color differences, or subtle shadows first. Borders add visual noise; the alternatives communicate structure more cleanly.

10. **Afterthought mobile**: Responsive is not "the same thing smaller." *Instead*: Mobile often needs different IA, different content priority, different interaction patterns.

11. **Ignoring font loading**: Fonts flash, shift, or render as system fallbacks for seconds. *Instead*: Font-display strategy, preloading critical fonts, size-adjust fallbacks.

12. **Arbitrary spacing**: Using whatever pixel value "looks right" without a system. *Instead*: Define a geometric spacing scale (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64) and use only those values. Weber-Fechner law: perceptually uniform steps require multiplicative increments.

13. **Disconnected layers**: Building a feature that looks complete — the UI renders, the API accepts requests, the database has tables — but the layers aren't actually wired together. The form submits to an endpoint that returns hardcoded data. The API writes to the database but the frontend reads from a different source. Types were generated once and never updated after the schema changed. *Instead*: Verify connectivity explicitly. After building a feature, trace a request from UI → API → DB → response → UI rendering. If any link is stubbed, mocked, or stale, the feature is not done. Run the regenerate-and-diff check on all derived artifacts. The system works when data flows through all layers and back.
