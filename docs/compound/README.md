# Compound Agent

A learning system for Claude Code that captures, indexes, and retrieves lessons learned during development sessions -- so the same mistakes are not repeated.

---

## What is compound-agent?

Compound-agent is a Go CLI that integrates with Claude Code. When Claude makes a mistake and gets corrected, or discovers a useful pattern, that knowledge is stored as a **memory item** in `.claude/lessons/index.jsonl`. Future sessions search this memory before planning and implementing.

The system uses:

- **JSONL storage** (`.claude/lessons/index.jsonl`) as the git-tracked source of truth
- **SQLite + FTS5** (`.claude/.cache/lessons.sqlite`) as a rebuildable search index
- **Semantic embeddings** (ca-embed Rust daemon with local model) for vector similarity search
- **Claude Code hooks** to inject memory at session start, before compaction, and on tool failures

Memory items have four types: `lesson`, `solution`, `pattern`, and `preference`. Each has a trigger, an insight, tags, severity, and optional citations.

## Quick start

```bash
# Initialize in your project:
ca init

# Full setup (includes embedding model download):
ca setup

# Verify installation:
ca doctor
```

### What `init` does

1. Creates `.claude/lessons/` directory and empty `index.jsonl`
2. Updates `AGENTS.md` with a compound-agent section
3. Adds a reference to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
4. Creates `.claude/plugin.json` manifest
5. Installs agent templates, workflow commands, phase skills, and agent role skills
6. Installs a git pre-commit hook (lesson capture reminder)
7. Installs Claude Code hooks (SessionStart, PreCompact, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUseFailure, PostToolUse, PreToolUse, Stop)
8. For pnpm projects: auto-configures `onlyBuiltDependencies` for native addons

`setup` does everything `init` does. The embedding model is managed separately by the embed daemon.
